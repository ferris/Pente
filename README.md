# Pente
Pente is a classic board game that is traditionally played on a 19x19 Go board (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente).

This project is an electronic recreation of the game, that uses a a custom parallelized version of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to create a competitive
AI for users to play against.

I programmed this project in Java with the Processing library.
